  abstract = {Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) background magnets are made from superconducting composite wires that are a metal matrix composite (MMC). Thermal and mechanical properties of the specific wire matrix must be known to optimize the wire configuration for MRI magnet designs. Computational analysis techniques based on numerical homogenization may provide an accurate characterization of a multifilament MMC wire and can reduce the expenses and time required for experimental tests. Recent developments in magnesium diboride (MgB2) superconducting wire has demonstrated their feasibility in a liquid helium (LHe) free conduction-cooled MRI magnet. Computational analysis of an entire superconducting magnet design requires the elastic and thermal properties of these wires. In this work, the temperature dependent elastic modulus, Poisson’s ratio, thermal expansion coefficients, thermal conductivity, and specific heat are estimated using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and compared to analytical approaches. The orthotropic elastic and thermal properties of four different superconducting composite wire configurations are evaluated. The experimental thermal conductivity and specific heat at room temperature agree well with its corresponding computational results. FEA based computational homogenization has been demonstrated as an acceptable method to estimate the required material properties of the MMC superconducting wire for magnet analysis of MRI manufacturing and operation.},

  abstract = {The winding of composite superconducting wire around a mandrel is one of the first stages of manufacturing processes of a superconducting magnet. Depending on the method of mechanical support conditions during winding, the strain development at the final stage in a superconducting magnet may vary significantly. Therefore, proper selection of the winding process is important to increase the feasibility for a conduction cooled full body MRI magnet based on magnesium diboride (MgB2), a strain sensitive high-temperature superconductor. A multiscale multiphysics finite element analysis) model of an 18 filament MgB2 wire is developed for strain estimation. The computationally homogenized representative volume element of the composite wire is used in the coil bundle in place of the actual MgB2 wire. The simulation considers winding, thermal cool-down and electromagnetic charging to estimate total strain developed at the final step-electromagnetic charging. Four different types of support conditions are studied and strain development is reported. Results suggest that a combination of radial and axial support at the inner radial surface and outermost axial surfaces of the mandrel, respectively, is the most favorable winding condition with a minimum strain development of 0.021\%, which is half in comparison to no mandrel support.},

  abstract = {High temperature superconductors such as MgB2 focus on conduction cooling of electromagnets that eliminates the use of liquid helium. With the recent advances in the strain sustainability of MgB2, a full body 1.5 T conduction cooled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) magnet shows promise. In this article, a 36 filament MgB2 superconducting wire is considered for a 1.5 T fullbody MRI system and is analyzed in terms of strain development. In order to facilitate analysis, this composite wire is homogenized and the orthotropic wire material properties are employed to solve for strain development using a 2D-axisymmetric finite element analysis (FEA) model of the entire set of MRI magnet. The entire multiscale multiphysics analysis is considered from the wire to the magnet bundles addressing winding, cooling and electromagnetic excitation. The FEA solution is verified with proven analytical equations and acceptable agreement is reported. The results show a maximum mechanical strain development of 0.06\% that is within the failure criteria of −0.6\% to 0.4\% (−0.3\% to 0.2\% for design) for the 36 filament MgB2 wire. Therefore, the study indicates the safe operation of the conduction cooled MgB2 based MRI magnet as far as strain development is concerned.},

Heuristic heat source calibration is proposed relating volumetric energy density (ψ) based on experiments available in the literature. The parameters of the heat source of the computational model are initially calibrated based on a Higher Order Proper Generalized Decomposition- (HOPGD) based surrogate model. The prediction using the calibrated heat source agrees quantitatively with NIST measurements for different process conditions (laser spot diameter, laser power, and scan speed). A scaling law based on keyhole formation is also utilized in calibrating the parameters of the cylindrical heat source and predicting the challenge experiments. In addition, an improvement on the heat source model is proposed to relate the Volumetric Energy Density (VED               σ               ) to the melt pool aspect ratio. The model shows further improvement in the prediction of the experimental measurements for the melt pool, including cases at higher VED               σ               . Overall, it is concluded that the appropriate selection of laser heat source parameterization scheme along with the heat source model is crucial in the accurate prediction of melt pool geometry and thermal measurements while bypassing the expensive computational simulations that consider increased physics equations.},

Ionic liquids, organic salts that have a lower melting point temperature, appear suitable for droplet-based micro-gripping application in high temperature and vacuum environments because of their nonvolatility and thermal stability. In this paper, we demonstrated the use of ionic liquid as the operating liquid for micro-gripping applications in high temperatures (up to 110 ◦C) and vacuum (up to 24 inch Hg) environments. Electrowetting was utilized to dynamically change the contact angle of a 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (BmimPF6) liquid bridge to control the capillary lifting forces. The lifting force generated by the liquid bridge was experimentally characterized. The range of capillary lifting forces can be adjusted by changing the liquid bridge height and droplet volume to pick up and release objects with different weights. The dynamic response of the BmimPF6 liquid bridge was also characterized.},

The sizes, locations, and number of turns in the eight coil bundles are determined using optimization methods that minimize the amount of superconducting wire and produce magnetic fields with an inhomogeneity of less than 10 ppm over a 45 cm diameter spherical volume. MgB2 superconducting wire is assessed in terms of the transport, thermal, and mechanical properties for these magnet designs. Careful calculations of the normal zone propagation velocity and minimum quench energies provide support for the necessity of active quench protection instead of passive protection for medium temperature superconductors such as MgB2. A new ‘active’ protection scheme for medium Tc based MRI magnets is presented and simulations demonstrate that the magnet can be protected. Recent progress on persistent joints for multifilamentary MgB2 wire is presented. Finite difference calculations of the quench propagation and temperature rise during a quench conclude that active intervention is needed to reduce the temperature rise in the coil bundles and prevent damage to the superconductor. Comprehensive multiphysics and multiscale analytical and finite element analysis of the mechanical stress and strain in the MgB2 wire and epoxy for these designs are presented for the first time. From mechanical and thermal analysis of our designs we conclude there would be no damage to such a magnet during the manufacturing or operating stages, and that the magnet would survive various quench scenarios. This comprehensive set of magnet design considerations and analyses demonstrate the overall viability of 1.5 and 3.0 T MgB2 magnet designs.},

It is found that inclusion of magnetoresistance in the simulation can significantly decrease the calculated maximum temperature reached in this magnet during a quench, e.g., by 9 K for RRR = 100. The inclusion of both magnetoresistance and MTC similarly decreases the peak temperature, but by a smaller amount, e.g., by 7 K for RRR = 100. Using copper with a lower RRR value can also significantly decrease the peak temperature reached in this magnet, e.g., by 16 K for RRR = 50 as compared to RRR = 200. However, decreasing the RRR value to much less than 50 results in a significantly higher voltage, e.g., decreasing the RRR value from 50 to 10 results in a 1000 V increase.

An active quench protection system relies on the detection of the resistive voltage developed in the magnet, which is used to trigger the external energizing of quench heaters located on the surfaces of all ten coil bundles. A numerical integration of the heat equation is used to determine the development of the temperature profile and the maximum temperature in the coil at the origin, or ‘hot spot’, of the quench. Both n-value of the superconductor and magnetoresistance of the wire are included in the simulations. An MgB2 wire manufactured by Hyper Tech Research, Inc. was used as the basis to model the wire for the simulations. With the proposed active quench protection system, the maximum temperature was limited to 200 K or less, which is considered low enough to prevent damage to the magnet. By substituting Glidcop for the Monel in the wire sheath or by increasing the thermal conductivity of the insulation, the margin for safe operation was further increased, the maximum temperature decreasing by more than 40 K. The strain on the MgB2 filaments is calculated using ANSYS, verifying that the stress and strain limits in the MgB2 superconductor and epoxy insulation are not exceeded.},

  abstract = {Functionally graded material (FGM) is a class of advanced materials, consisting of two (or more) different constituents, that possesses a continuously varying composition profile. With the advancement of nanotechnology, applications of FGMs have shifted from their conventional usage towards sophisticated micro and nanoscale electronics and energy conversion devices. Therefore, the study of mechanical and vibrational properties of different FGM nanostructures is crucial in exploring their feasibility for different applications. In this study, for the first time, we employed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the mechanical and vibrational properties of radially graded Cu–Ni FGM nanowires (NW). Distribution of Cu and Ni along the radial direction follows power-law, exponential and sigmoid functions for FGM NWs under consideration. Our results demonstrate that distribution function parameters play an important role in modulating the mechanical (elastic modulus and ultimate tensile strength) and vibrational (natural frequency and quality factor) properties of FGM NWs. The study also suggests that elastic moduli of FGM NWs can be predicted with relatively good accuracy using Tamura and Reuss micromechanical models, regardless of NW diameter. We found that Euler-Bernoulli beam theory under-predicts the natural frequencies of FGM NWs, whereas He-Lilley model closely approximates the MD results. Interestingly, FGM NWs are always found to exhibit beat vibration because of their asymmetrical cross sections. Finally, this is the first atomistic scale study of FGMs that directly compares MD simulations with continuum theories and micromechanical models to understand the underlying mechanisms that govern the mechanical and vibrational properties of FGM NWs in nanoscale.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a statistical physics-based machine learning model for predicting defects, such as surface roughness and lack-of-fusion porosity, in the laser powder bed fusion of metals (PBF-LB/M) additive manufacturing process. The statistical physics-based model is calibrated and validated against controlled single-track experiments and used for statistical prediction for multi-layer and multi-track cases for PBF-LB/M defects. A mechanistic reduced-order-based stochastic calibration process is introduced to capture the stochastic nature of the melt pool. The calibrated physics-based digital shadow model is demonstrated for predicting the surface roughness of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) overhang part X4, with a difference of 9.3\% compared to the experimental results. By leveraging data obtained from both the physics-based model and experiments, a machine learning model has been trained for fast predictions (inference time of 0.4 ms) with high accuracy (error bound of 6.7\%). This model can predict melt pool geometries under various processing conditions, offering a control strategy for the PBF-LB/M process. Further, the trained machine learning model is showcased to demonstrate a control application of melt pool geometries (width and depth) for specific processing parameters. These developed models (physics-based and machine learning) serve as a digital shadow of the PBF-LB/M process, offering predictive capabilities to build a digital twin model for process control, optimization, and online monitoring.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the concept of reduced order machine learning finite element (FE) method. In particular, we propose an example of such method, the proper generalized decomposition (PGD) reduced hierarchical deeplearning neural networks (HiDeNN), called HiDeNN-PGD. We described first the HiDeNN interface seamlessly with the current commercial and open source FE codes. The proposed reduced order method can reduce significantly the degrees of freedom for machine learning and physics based modeling and is able to deal with high dimensional problems. This method is found more accurate than conventional finite element methods with a small portion of degrees of freedom. Different potential applications of the method, including topology optimization, multi-scale and multi-physics material modeling, and additive manufacturing, will be discussed in the paper.},

  abstract = {Stanene, a graphene like two dimensional honeycomb structure of tin has attractive features in electronics application. In this study, we performed molecular dynamics simulations using modified embedded atom method potential to investigate mechanical properties of stanene. We studied the effect of temperature and strain rate on mechanical properties of α-stanene for both uniaxial and biaxial loading conditions. Our study suggests that with the increasing temperature, both the fracture strength and strain of the stanene decrease. Uniaxial loading in zigzag direction shows higher fracture strength and strain compared to the armchair direction, while no noticeable variation in the mechanical properties is observed for biaxial loading. We also found at a higher loading rate, material exhibits higher fracture strength and strain. These results will aid further investigation of stanene as a potential nano-electronics substitute.},

  abstract = {Mechanical analysis of the stress and strains developed in the coils were calculated for a ten coil 1.5\,T MRI magnet design with magnesium diboride (MgB2) wire protected with Coupling Loss Induced Quench (CLIQ). The temperature distribution inside the coils was first simulated in MATLAB to solve the governing heat and circuit equations. Simulations were performed on the magnet, in which each coil was divided into two subsections, with two CLIQ units while the capacitor ranged from 5 to 20\,mF and the initial charging voltage ranged from 2.6\,kV to 1.3\,kV in order to keep the total stored energy in the CLIQ system constant. The wire’s filamentary twist pitch remained constant at 5\,cm for all simulations. The exported temperature distribution was expanded to form a representative unit cell (RUC) representing the wire composite and then imported into ANSYS to calculate the 1st principle strain in the MgB2 filament and shear stress across the epoxy for the coils. A peak temperature of 191\,K occurred inside the coil with the initial quench when the CLIQ unit had a 20 mF capacitor charged to 1.3\,kV. According to the mechanical simulations, the largest resulting peak strain in the wire was 0.034\%, and peak shear stress was 44\,MPa.},

  abstract = {In this report, we use first-principles calculations to study the methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) perovskite interfaces with titanium dioxide (TiO2), zinc oxide (ZnO), and tin oxide (SnO2). Our study suggests that the binding energy of MAPI on SnO2 is weak compared to TiO2 and ZnO. However, we show that the strong binding to TiO2 and ZnO deprotonates CH3NH3 molecules which influences the decomposition process. Among the three interfaces studied in this report, TiO2-based interfaces showed the highest charge transfer followed by the interfaces formed on SnO2. We report a possible interfacial recombination mechanism inside MAPI/TiO2 and MAPI/SnO2 devices. Our study concludes that MAPI/SnO2 interfaces provide advantages due to their improved stability for perovskite solar cells.},
